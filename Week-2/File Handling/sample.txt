Python is a versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

With its extensive standard library and vast ecosystem of third-party packages, Python is used in various domains such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and scientific computing.

The language's clean syntax and emphasis on code readability make it an excellent choice for beginners while being powerful enough for professional developers. Python's philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.

One of Python's key features is its dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It also supports multiple programming paradigms and has a large, comprehensive standard library often described as "batteries included".
