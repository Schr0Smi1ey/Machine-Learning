    "# File Handling in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "File handling allows you to work with files on your computer system - creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening Files\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Basic syntax\n",
    "file = open(\"filename.txt\", \"mode\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Common Modes\n",
    "- `'r'` - Read (default) - Opens file for reading only\n",
    "- `'w'` - Write (overwrites) - Creates new file or overwrites existing one\n",
    "- `'a'` - Append - Adds content to end of file without overwriting\n",
    "- `'x'` - Create - Creates new file, fails if file already exists\n",
    "- `'b'` - Binary mode - Used for non-text files (images, executables, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading Files\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    # file.readlines() for list of lines\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing Files\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"file.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic File Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading Methods\n",
    "- `read()` - Reads entire file content as string\n",
    "- `readline()` - Reads single line from file\n",
    "- `readlines()` - Reads all lines into a list\n",
    "- `read(size)` - Reads specified number of bytes/characters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing Methods\n",
    "- `write(string)` - Writes string to file\n",
    "- `writelines(list)` - Writes list of strings to file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Position Methods\n",
    "- `seek(offset)` - Moves cursor to specified position\n",
    "- `tell()` - Returns current cursor position\n",
    "\n",
    "### Management Methods\n",
    "- `close()` - Closes the file\n",
    "- `flush()` - Flushes internal buffer"
